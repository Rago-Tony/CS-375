I chose this website because it allows you to play with all of the WebGl experiments. There was a ton of impressive projects 
and each one had unqiue features that allowed me to fully grasp the limitatios of WebGl. My favoritve one that I found allowed me to
change the number of fish swimming in a fish tank, you can even add sharks! Overall, this website gave me great insight into what
you can do with WebGl.
